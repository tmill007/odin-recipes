<h3>Grilled Pork Chops with a kick!</h3>
<p>Seafood seasoning is used to make a marinade that gives these grilled pork chops the delicious flavor of the Chesapeake Bay. More seafood seasoning can be sprinkled on at grill time to provide an extra kick.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>½ cup apple cider vinegar</li> 
    <li>1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>
    <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>

<hr>  
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk together the vegetable oil, apple cider vinegar, seafood seasoning, minced garlic, basil, lime juice, and black pepper in a bowl, and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the pork chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours, flipping periodically.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the pork chops from the bags. Discard excess marinade.</li>
    <li>Grill until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
