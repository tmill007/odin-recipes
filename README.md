# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes - odin project

Build a basic recipe website. 

The site will consist of:
	* A main index page - which will have links to a few recipes
	

-- The purpose of this site is just to solidify the HTML knowledge learned to date.
-- CSS is not required at this point and visual appearance is not required at this stage.
